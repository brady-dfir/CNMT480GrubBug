# CNMT480GrubBug
Intentionally vulnerable web application for cybersecurity education
Grubbug Documentation

Project Overview

Grubbug is an intentionally vulnerable web application designed for instruction, practice, and evaluation of cybersecurity students. It provides hands-on experience with real-world vulnerabilities while giving instructors a measurable way to track student performance. It features ten challenges based on the OWASP Top Ten list. The current set of challenges is based on the 2021 OWASP Top Ten list.

Core Features

Vulnerability Randomizer: Each student will be assigned a random challenge

Progress Tracking: Completion flags are stored per user to prevent repeated challenges and allow instructors to view student progress.

Dynamic Solutions: Submitted answers are validated against a separate solutions database for completion and feedback.

Administrator Features: Admin users can be manually created to manage content and monitor student activity

Technologies Used

Python: Core scripting and backend

Flask: Web framework for routing and API endpoints

SQLite: Database framework for user progress and challenge solutions

bcrypt: Password hashing for user authentication

HTML/CSS: Frontend templates and UI

Setup Instructions

How to Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy python-dotenv bcrypt

How To Initialize Databases

Grubbug uses two databases: users.db and solutions.db. The databases are separated for security reasons.

users.db stores usernames, passwords, and challenge completion progress. To initialize users.db run:

python init_db.py

solutions.db stores correct answers and explanations for each challenge. To initialize solutions.db run:

python init_solutions.py

How to Run App Locally

flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000

Database Schemas

Tables in users.db and solutions.db

users.db: Stores usernames, hashed passwords, and challenge completion flags.

solutions.db: Stores correct answers and explanations for each challenge. Maps each challenge ID to its correct solution and explanation.

Column Definitions

users.db

Column

Type

Description

Id

INTEGER

Primary key

Username

TEXT UNIQUE

Unique identifier for each user

password

TEXT

Hashed password

Tag

TEXT

Based on assigned role: student or admin

Current_Challenge

INTEGER

1-10 based on current challenge

A01_2021_done

INTEGER

1 if complete, 0 or NULL if incomplete

A02_2021_done

INTEGER

Same as above, follows pattern through A10_2021_done

solutions.db

Column

Type

Description

challenge_id

TEXT

Primary key, A01_2021 through A10_2021

correct_answer

TEXT

Challenge flag or answer string

explanation

TEXT

Explanation shown if answer is incorrect

How Challenge Progress is Tracked

When a user correctly solves a challenge, the app updates the corresponding AXX_2021_done to 1.

The chooseRandom function in vulnRandomizer.py uses these flags to avoid showing a challenge that has already been seen

Core Logic

How Challenge Assignment Works

Challenges are randomly assigned by the chooseRandom function in vulnRandomizer.py. This function is designed to assign challenges that the user has not seen or completed yet.

The vulnerability randomizer checks all challenge flags for a user, identifies completed challenges, randomly selects one of the remaining challenges, and returns the selected challenge to the user on the frontend.

How Challenges are Validated

Answer validation is handled by the dynamicSolution route in app.py. This checks a user’s answer against the stored answer in solutions.db.

("SELECT correct_answer, explanation FROM solutions WHERE challenge_id = ?", (challenge_id,))

This will compare the user input to the correct answer and will return with “Correct” if correct or “Try again” with feedback.

How Admin Users are Added

Admin users are created by using AddAdminToDB.py. This will insert the admin user with into users.db. Passwords are hashed securely by using bcrypt.

File Structure

Scripts and Purpose

File Name

Description

app.py

Main Flask application. Handles app routes, user interactions, core functions.

init_db.py

Creates the users database and challenge columns.

init_solutions.py

Creates and populates solutions table.

AddAdminToDB.py

Allows an admin user to be created and added to the user database.

vulnRandomizer.py

Contains functions for the vulnerability randomizer and progress tracking.

Templates, Static Files, and Data

Challenge template pages, teacher pages, login pages, and the home page can all be found in the templates folder. Static files such as images, JavaScript files, and CSS files can all be found in the static folder. The users database can be found the data folder.

Common Tasks

How to Add a New Challenge

Follow these steps to add a new challenge to Gubbug:

Create the challenge page in the templates folder (Example: AXX_2021.html)

Add route logic to app.py

@app.route('/AXX_2021')

def AXX_2021():

if 'username' not in session: 

    return redirect(url_for('home')) 



 

return render_template('AXX_2021/AXX_2021.html') 
@app.route('/AXX_2021_Flag')

def AXX_2021_Flag():

    if 'username' not in session:

        return redirect(url_for('home'))

    mark_challenge_complete(session['username'], 2)

    return render_template('AXX_2021/AXX_2021_Flag.html')

Update solutions.db with the correct answer and explanation

Update users.db to include a new progress flag (SQL: ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN A11_2021_done INTEGER DEFAULT 0;)

How to Reset User Progress

To reset user progress, use the reset function found in vulnRandomizer.py

How to Update a Solution or Explanation

To update an existing challenge’s solution and/or explanation, manually update solutions.db.

Security Notes

Password Hashing

Grubbug uses bcrypt to securely hash stored passwords in users.db. This hash is stored in the password column of users.db. This ensures that all passwords will have unique hashes.

hashed_pw = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())

Separation of User and Solution Data

Grubbug uses two separate databases, users.db and solutions.db. These databases contain information that is only visible to admin users. These databases are separate because they contain different information. It also reduces the risk of accidental exposure
